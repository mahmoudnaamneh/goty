   <h2>about The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h2>
  <pre>
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[b] is a 2015 action role-playing game developed and published by CD Projekt. 
It is the sequel to the 2011 game The Witcher 2: 
Assassins of Kings and the third game in The Witcher video game series, 
played in an open world with a third-person perspective.
The games follow The Witcher series of fantasy novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski.
The game takes place in a fictional fantasy world based on Slavic mythology. 
Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher, and search for his adopted daughter,
who is on the run from the otherworldly Wild Hunt.
Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, 
and complete quests to acquire experience points and gold, 
which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment. 
The game's story has three possible endings, determined by the player's choices at key points in the narrative.
Development began in 2011 and lasted for three and a half years.
Central and Northern European cultures formed the basis of the game's world.
The game was developed using the REDengine 3, 
which enabled CD Projekt to create a complex story without compromising its open world. 
The music was primarily composed by Marcin Przybyłowicz and performed by the Brandenburg State Orchestra.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in May 2015, 
with a Nintendo Switch version released in October 2019,
and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions titled The Witcher 3: 
Wild Hunt - Complete Edition which was released in December 2022. 
The game received critical acclaim, with praise for its gameplay, 
narrative, world design, combat, and visuals, 
although it received minor criticism due to technical issues. 
holds more than 200 game of the year awards and has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made.
Two expansions were also released to critical acclaim: Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.
A Game of the Year edition was released in August 2016, 
with the base game, expansions and all downloadable content included.
The game shipped over 40 million copies, 
making it one of the best-selling video games of all time.

     <h2 >Gameplay</h2>
     <pre>
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action role-playing game with a third-person perspective.
Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer known as a Witcher.
Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and swims.
He has a variety of weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver).
The steel sword is used primarily to kill humans while the silver sword is more effective against creatures and monsters.
Players can draw out, switch and sheathe their swords at will. There are two modes of melee attack; 
light attacks are fast but weak, and heavy attacks are slow but strong.
Players can block and counter enemy attacks with their swords. Swords have limited endurance and require regular repair. 
In addition to physical attacks, Geralt has five magical signs at his disposal: Aard, Axii, Igni, Yrden and Quen.
Aard prompts Geralt to unleash a telekinetic blast, Axii confuses enemies, Igni burns them, 
Yrden slows them down and Quen offers players a temporary, protective shield.
The signs use stamina, and cannot be used indefinitely.
Players can use mutagens to increase Geralt's magic power. Geralt loses health when attacked by enemies,
although wearing armour can help reduce health loss.
Health is restored with meditation or consumables, such as food and potions.
Players occasionally control Ciri, Geralt's adoptive daughter who can teleport short distances.

        <h2>Development</h2>
     <pre>
Although the game was planned to begin production in 2008, 
CD Projekt Red's preoccupation with Rise of the White Wolf pushed it back to 2011.
The company developed The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt with a self-funded budget of US$81 million[c] over three-and-a-half years. 
project began with 150 employees, eventually growing to over 250 in-house staff.
1,500 people were involved in the production globally. 
While the game is based on Andrzej Sapkowski's novels, 
it is not an official continuation of them and 
Sapkowski's involvement with the game was limited to the creation of its in-game map.
The game was localised in 15 languages, with a total of 500 voice actors.
The game was scripted concurrently in Polish and English to alleviate difficulty in localisation.
According to Side (the company which handled voice casting and recording), the 450,000-word script had 950 speaking roles. 
The voices were recorded from late 2012 to early 2015.
CD Projekt Red wanted the game to be free of any digital rights management (DRM) due to
the developer's unsuccessful control of piracy with its predecessor,
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, whose DRM also made it run slowly.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was created with the REDengine 3, 
CD Projekt Red's proprietary game engine designed for nonlinear role-playing video games set in open world environments, 
aided by the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles and prepared for use in October 2014. 
The first play-through indicated to the developers that the open world, 
despite its content and generation around the quests, seemed empty. 
As a solution, they added points of interest. The game had 5,000 bugs that December, 
which (with a launch date of February 2015) necessitated its postponement.
Like the previous two Witcher games, 
players are given a complex story with multiple choices and consequences. Unlike other game engines,
REDengine 3 permits a complex storyline without sacrificing virtual world design.

        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <pre>
Geralt and his mentor Vesemir arrive at the town of White Orchard after receiving a letter from Geralt's long-lost lover Yennefer. 
After defeating a griffin for the local Nilfgaardian garrison, 
Geralt accompanies Yennefer to the city of Vizima, where they meet with Emperor Emhyr. 
Emhyr orders Geralt to find Ciri, who is Emhyr's biological, and Geralt's adopted daughter. 
Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that grants her the power to manipulate time and space,
and is being relentlessly stalked by the enigmatic Wild Hunt.
Geralt learns of three places Ciri was recently seen: the war-ravaged swamp province of Velen, the free city-state of Novigrad, and the Skellige Isles.
In Velen, Geralt tracks Ciri to the fortress of the Bloody Baron, a warlord who recently took over the province. 
The Baron demands that Geralt find his missing wife and daughter in exchange for information about Ciri. 
Geralt learns that the Baron drove his own family away with his drunken rages; while his daughter fled to Oxenfurt,
his wife Anna became a servant of the Crones, three malicious witches that watch over Velen.
He also discovers that Ciri was briefly captured by the Crones, but escaped to the Baron's stronghold before continuing on to Novigrad.
At Novigrad, Geralt reunites with his former lover Triss Merigold, who has gone underground to escape persecution by the Church of the Eternal Fire. 
He learns that Ciri and his old friend Dandelion ran afoul of Novigrad's powerful crime bosses while seeking to break a curse related to a mysterious phylactery.
With the help of Triss and several old acquaintances, Geralt rescues Dandelion, who tells him that Ciri teleported to Skellige to escape pursuit by guards.
Geralt sails to Skellige and reunites with Yennefer, who is investigating a magical explosion near where Ciri was last seen.
