   <pre>
Elden Ring is an action role-playing game played in a third person perspective, 
with gameplay focusing on combat and exploration. It features elements similar to those found in other games developed by FromSoftware, 
such as the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, 
and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Set in an open world, players are allowed to freely explore the Lands Between and its six main areas; 
these locations range from Limgrave, an area featuring grassy plains and ancient ruins, to Caelid, 
a wasteland home to undead monsters.[1] Open world areas are explorable using the character's mount, Torrent, 
as the primary mode of transportation, along with the ability to fast travel outside of combat. Throughout the game, 
players encounter non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies, 
including the demigods who rule each main area and serve as the game's main bosses. 
Aside from open world areas, Elden Ring also features hidden dungeons, such as catacombs, tunnels, 
and caves where players can fight bosses and gather helpful items.
The player chooses a character class at the start of the game, 
which determines their starting spells, equipment, and attributes.

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <pre>
FromSoftware had previously been known for developing the Dark Souls series, 
noted for their high level of difficulty.Director Hidetaka Miyazaki wanted to create an open world game, 
intending Elden Ring as a mechanical evolution to Dark Souls. 
The game was designed to have a more expansive environment compared to the narrow dungeons of FromSoftware's previous games, 
with Miyazaki hoping that the grander scale would add freedom and depth to exploration. 
FromSoftware approached American author George R. R. Martin, 
known for the A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels, to provide worldbuilding for Elden Ring. 
A fan of Martin's work, Miyazaki hoped Martin's contributions would produce a more accessible narrative than the studio's previous games.

            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <pre>
Early on in their journey to repair the Elden Ring, 
the Tarnished encounters a maiden named Melina. 
As the Tarnished is maidenless, Melina offers to act as their maiden, 
granting them the ability to turn runes into strength, as well as giving the Tarnished their steed Torrent. 
She does this under the condition that the Tarnished brings her to the Erdtree, the home of the Elden Ring. 
Melina later takes the Tarnished to the Roundtable Hold, a gathering place for other Tarnished seeking to repair the Elden Ring. 
The Hold's benefactor, the Two Fingers, instructs the Tarnished to collect the Great Runes and bring them to the Erdtree, 
where they can be used to repair the Elden Ring.
