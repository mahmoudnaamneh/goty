     The Game Awards is an annual awards ceremony honoring achievements in the video game industry.
     Established in 2014, the shows are produced and hosted by game journalist Geoff Keighley, 
     who worked on its predecessor, the Spike Video Game Awards, for over ten years.
     In addition to the awards, The Game Awards features premieres of upcoming games and new information
     on previously-announced titles.
