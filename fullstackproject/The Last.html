            <h2>The Last of Us Part II</h2>
            <pre>
The Last of Us Part II is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and
published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. 
Set five years after The Last of Us (2013), the game focuses on two playable characters in 
a post-apocalyptic United States whose lives intertwine: Ellie, who sets out in revenge for a murder, 
and Abby, a soldier who becomes involved in a conflict between her militia and a religious cult. 
The game uses a third-person perspective; the player must fight human enemies and 
cannibalistic zombie-like creatures with firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <pre>
The Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective featuring elements of the survival horror genre.
The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as buildings and forests to advance the story. 
The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and
cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.
Control intermittently switches between Ellie and Abby; the player also briefly controls Joel in the opening sequence.
The nimble nature of the player character introduces platforming elements, 
allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages during combat. 
The player can break glass objects such as windows to access certain areas or obtain supplies. 
Some areas are navigated by horse or boat.
In combt, the player can use long-range weapons such as rifles and bows, and short-range weapons such as pistols and revolvers. 
The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons such as machetes and hammers,
and throw bricks and bottles to distract or attack enemies.

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <pre>
Early story concepts for The Last of Us Part II were conceived during the development of The Last of Us in 2013.
Naughty Dog began development in 2014, soon after the release of The Last of Us Remastered.
By August 2017, with the release of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, the entire 350-person team at Naughty Dog had shifted to develop Part II. 
Neil Druckmann led development as creative director and writer, reprising his role from The Last of Us and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016).
Anthony Newman and Kurt Margenau were selected to be co-game directors for Part II,
overseeing gameplay elements such as level design and mechanics.
For the final months of development, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the team operated via remote work arrangements.
In total, approximately 2,169 developers across 14 studios worked on the game.

            <pre>
Joel Miller (Troy Baker) confesses to his brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) his responsibility in preventing the Fireflies attempting
to find a cure for the Cordyceps fungus pandemic by saving Ellie (Ashley Johnson) from an operation that would have killed her. Four years later, 
Joel and Ellie have built a life in Jackson, Wyoming, though their relationship has become strained. 
While on patrol, Joel and Tommy rescue a stranger, Abby Anderson (Laura Bailey), from an Infected horde. 
They return to an outpost being used as a temporary hideout by Abby's group, former Fireflies now part of 
the Washington Liberation Front (WLF), a militia group based in Seattle, Washington. The group attack Joel and Tommy; 
Abby seeks revenge against Joel for murdering her father, the Firefly surgeon (Derek Phillips) who was to perform the operation on Ellie. 
Meanwhile, Ellie and her girlfriend Dina (Shannon Woodward) leave Jackson in search of the brothers. 
Ellie enters the WLF camp to witness Abby beat Joel to death and swears revenge.
