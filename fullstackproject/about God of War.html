      <h2>God of War</h2>
   <pre>
    God of War[b] is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. 
    It was released for the PlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a Windows port in January 2022. 
    The game is the eighth installment in the God of War series, the eighth chronologically, 
    and the sequel to 2010's God of War III. Unlike previous games,
    which were loosely based on Greek mythology, 
    this installment is loosely inspired by Norse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient Scandinavia in the realm of Midgard. 
    For the first time in the series, there are two protagonists: Kratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only playable character, 
    and his young son, Atreus. Following the death of Kratos' second wife Faye—Atreus'
    mother—the two embark on a journey to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms.
    Kratos keeps his troubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his divine nature. 
    Along their journey, they come into conflict with monsters and gods of the Norse world.
    Described by creative director Cory Barlog as a reimagining of the franchise, 
    a major gameplay change is that Kratos makes prominent use of a magical battle axe instead of his signature double-chained blades.
    God of War also uses an over-the-shoulder free camera, with the game in one shot, 
    as opposed to the fixed cinematic camera of the previous entries. 
    The game also includes role-playing video game elements, and Kratos' son Atreus provides assistance in combat.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
   <pre>
    God of War is a third-person action-adventure video game.
    It features an over-the-shoulder free camera, a departure from the previous installments, 
    which featured a fixed cinematic camera (with the exception of 2007's two-dimensional side-scroller Betrayal).
    Cinematographically, the game is presented in a continuous shot, with no camera cuts or loading screens.
    Although the previous main installment, Ascension (2013), introduced multiplayer to the series,
    this installment is single-player-only.
    Regarding the level structure, creative director Cory Barlog said "it's open, but it is not an open world."
    Due to its openness, a fast travel feature is unlocked later in the game. Swimming, an ability in previous games,
    was cut; players instead use a boat to traverse bodies of water.
    Unlike previous games, which allowed players to jump freely at anytime, 
    jumping can now only be done at designated areas, such as at a rock face or ledge. 
    Throughout the game, players battle Norse mythological foes, like dark elves, 
    wulvers, and draugrs,[12] as well as Gullveig and the revenants, beings warped by seiðr magic, among many others.
    Valkyries appear as optional boss battles. Among the many side quests, players can free the imprisoned dragons Fáfnir, Otr,
    and Reginn—dwarves who were turned into dragons—in addition to battling one called Hræzlyr, a story-based boss battle.

   <h2>Development</h2>
   <pre>
      Development on the next God of War began in 2014.
      This was confirmed by Santa Monica Studio's creative director Cory Barlog at the first annual PlayStation Experience on December 6 that year,
      where Barlog said the game was in very early development, and that it would not be a prequel, but possibly a reboot. 
      In April 2016, concept art was leaked that showed images of Kratos in the world of Norse mythology,
      a concept originally considered by series creator David Jaffe after Kratos eliminated the Greek gods.
      The game's official announcement came at the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) with a gameplay demo that confirmed the setting. 
      The demo showed a fully bearded Kratos teaching his son how to hunt. The pair also battled a troll.
      The end of the demo showed the title God of War and confirmed it was in development for the PlayStation 4 (PS4).
      The E3 announcement also confirmed that Barlog had returned to the series as game director for the new installment.
      Since the original 2005 game, Barlog has been a major contributor in the development of the series, 
      previously most notably as the director of God of War II (2007); this new installment was his fifth God of War game.
      Barlog said the game was titled God of War with no numeral or subtitle because, 
      although it was a continuation of the series, "we ... [reimagined] everything."
      Head of Santa Monica Studio, Shannon Studstill, and Barlog said that Sony Interactive Entertainment had to be convinced to 
      do another God of War game as many people at Sony wanted the series to "sleep and 
      rest" due to the lackluster response to the previous game, Ascension.
      In explaining why Barlog was brought back, Studstill said he knew the series very well, 
      "and bringing in someone that understands that history is the respect the franchise deserves.
     "Barlog responded, "You gotta know the rules to break the rules." Series creator David Jaffe was also considered but was unavailable.

            <h2>Plot</h2>
   <pre>
    Many years after defeating the Olympian gods,
   [e] Kratos now lives with his son Atreus in the realm of Midgard and is often abrasive and passive aggressive towards him.
    After cremating the body of his second wife, Faye, Kratos is confronted by a stranger with godly powers. 
    The two battle and Kratos seemingly kills the stranger,
    after which Kratos and Atreus begin their journey to honor Faye's last wish: 
    to scatter her ashes at the highest peak in the nine realms.
    Along the way, they encounter the kindly Witch of the Woods, who recognizes Kratos as a god, 
    as well as the Huldra Brothers, Brok and Sindri.
    Reaching the Lake of the Nine, the pair encounter the friendly World Serpent, Jörmungandr, 
    believed to be the last remaining Giant. 
    Continuing on their journey, they find their path blocked by impenetrable black mist; 
    the Witch appears and instructs them to use the Bifröst to travel to Alfheim and secure its magical light to extinguish the mist.
    Successful, they reach Midgard's peak and overhear a conversation between the stranger—revealed to be Baldur—his nephews, 
    Modi and Magni, and the imprisoned Mímir.
    After they leave, Kratos and Atreus confront Mímir, who reveals that the highest peak is actually in Jötunheim, 
    but the Giants have blocked travel there to keep out Odin and Thor.
    Knowing of another passage, Mímir instructs Kratos to behead him and have his head revived by the Witch of the Woods, 
    whom, upon resurrection, he reveals to be the goddess Freya.
    Kratos' longstanding hatred of gods causes him to immediately distrust her, 
    but both Freya and Mímir warn him that he must tell Atreus about his true nature.
