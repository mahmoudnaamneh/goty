     <h2>about Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h2>
<pre>
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice[a] is a 2019 action-adventure game developed by FromSoftware and published by Activision.
The game follows a shinobi known as Wolf, who attempts to take revenge on a samurai clan that imprisoned him and kidnapped his lord. 
The gameplay is focused on stealth, exploration, and combat, with a particular emphasis on boss battles.
It takes place in a fictionalized Japan during the Sengoku period and makes strong references to Buddhist mythology and philosophy.
Sekiro was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in March 2019,
and for Stadia in October 2020. Lead director Hidetaka Miyazaki wanted to create a 
new intellectual property (IP) that marked a departure from their Dark Souls series, 
looking at games such as Tenchu for inspiration. Sekiro was praised by critics, who complimented its gameplay and setting,
and compared it to Dark Souls, although opinions on its difficulty were mixed. 
It won several year-end awards and sold over five million copies by July 2020.

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <pre>
Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an action-adventure game played from a third-person view.
Compared to FromSoftware's Dark Souls series, the game features fewer role-playing elements, 
lacks character creation and the ability to level up a variety of stats, and has no multiplayer elements.
It does, however, include gear upgrading, a skill tree, and limited ability customization. 
Rather than attacking to whittle an enemy's health points, combat in Sekiro revolves around using a katana to 
attack their posture and balance instead, eventually leading to an opening that allows for a single killing blow.
The game also features stealth elements, allowing players to instantly eliminate some enemies if they can get in range undetected.
In addition, the player character can use various tools to assist with combat and exploration, 
such as a grappling hook.[3] If the player character dies, they can be revived on the spot if they have resurrection power,
 which is restored by defeating enemies, instead of respawning at earlier checkpoints.

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <pre>
Development of Sekiro began in late 2015 following the completion of Bloodborne's downloadable content, 
The Old Hunters. It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki, who had previously worked on the Dark Souls series and Bloodborne.
Sekiro draws inspiration from the Tenchu series of stealth-action games partially developed and published by FromSoftware. 
The team initially considered developing the game as a sequel to Tenchu; however, it quickly outgrew the concept. 
Miyazaki intended the combat changes to capture the feel of "swords clashing",
 with fighters trying to create an opening to deliver the fatal strike. 
He and the team also created the game to be an entirely single-player experience, 
as they believed multiplayer to have limitations they wanted to avoid.
Despite the game taking place during the Sengoku period of real-world Japanese history,
 no historical people or locations are featured in the game.
