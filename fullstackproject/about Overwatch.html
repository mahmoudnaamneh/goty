      <h2>about Overwatch</h2>
   <pre>
    Overwatch was a 2016 team-based multiplayer first-person shooter game by Blizzard Entertainment. 
    The game was first released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in May 2016 and Nintendo Switch in October 2019. 
    Cross-platform play was supported across all platforms.
    Described as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigned players into two teams of six, 
    with each player selecting from a large roster of characters,
    known as "heroes", with unique abilities. 
    Teams worked to complete map-specific objectives within a limited period of time. 
    Overwatch is Blizzard's fourth major franchise and came about following the 2014 cancellation of 
    a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Titan.
    A portion of the Titan team were inspired by the success of
    team-based first-person shooters like Team Fortress 2 and the popularity of multiplayer online battle arena games,

   <h2>Gameplay</h2>
   <pre>
    Overwatch was an online team-based game generally played as a first-person shooter.
    The game featured several different game modes, 
    principally designed around squad-based combat with two opposing teams of six players each.
    Players selected one of over two dozen pre-made hero characters from one of three class types: 
    Damage heroes that deal most of the damage to attack or defend control points,
    Tank heroes that can absorb a large amount of damage, and Support heroes that provide healing or other buffs for their teammates.
    Each hero had a unique skill kit, defining their intrinsic attributes like health points and running speed, 
    their primary attacks, several active and passive skills,
    and an ultimate ability that can only be used after it has been charged through dealing damage to enemies and healing allies. 
    Players can change their hero during the course of a match,
    as a goal of Overwatch's design was to encourage dynamic team compositions that adapt to the situation.
    The game's genre has been described by some journalists as a "hero shooter",
    due to its design around specific heroes and classes.

    <h2>Development</h2>
   <pre>
    Overwatch came about in the aftermath of Blizzard's decision to cancel the 
    massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan in 2013,
    a project that had been in development for about seven years.
    While most others assigned to the project were transferred to other departments within Blizzard, 
    a small team of about 40 people, led by director Jeff Kaplan,
    were tasked to come up with a new concept for a game in a few months.
    After some brainstorming, they came onto the idea of a hero team-based shooter, 
    building upon the success of games like Team Fortress 2 and multiplayer online battle arenas.
    They started with assets developed for Titan to demonstrate the proof-of-concept and
    were greenlit to build out the full game, 
    the first new intellectual property that Blizzard had developed since StarCraft.
    The intra-company experience of Titan's cancellation served to help drive the narrative and setting.

   <h2>Plot</h2>
   <pre>
    The backstory to Overwatch is described through animated shorts and
    other information distributed by Blizzard in promoting the game.
    Overwatch is set sixty years into the future of a fictionalized Earth, 
    thirty years after the resolution of what is known as the "Omnic Crisis.
    Before the Omnic Crisis, humanity had been in a golden age of prosperity and technology development. 
    Humans developed robots with artificial intelligence called "Omnics", which were put to use to achieve economic equality, 
    and began to be treated as people in their own right. 
    The Omnic Crisis began when the worldwide automated "omnium" facilities that produced them started producing a series of lethal, 
    hostile robots that attacked humankind. 
    After individual nations' efforts failed to ward off the Omnics, the United Nations quickly formed Overwatch, 
    an international task force designed to combat this threat and restore order.
    Two veteran soldiers from the Soldier Enhancement Program were put in charge of Overwatch: Gabriel Reyes and Jack Morrison.
    Though Overwatch successfully quelled the robotic uprising and
    brought many talented individuals to the forefront,
    a rift developed between Reyes and Morrison due to Reyes being the official leader of
    the group despite everyone viewing the more popular Morrison as their true leader. 
    Eventually, Morrison was made the leader of Overwatch while Reyes was given charge of Blackwatch, 
    Overwatch's covert operations division, fighting terrorist organizations like Talon, 
    a group that appears to be trying to start a second Omnic Crisis, and Null Sector, 
    a group of Omnics that revolted against the society that persecuted Omnics following the first Crisis.
    Overwatch continued to maintain peace across the world for several decades in what came to be called the
   "Overwatch Generation" as the team gained more members, but the rift between Morrison and Reyes intensified.
