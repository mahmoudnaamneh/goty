It Takes Two is an action-adventure platform video game developed by Hazelight Studios and published by Electronic Arts.
It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in March 2021,
and was released for Nintendo Switch in November 2022. Like Hazelight's debut game A Way Out, 
it does not have a single-player option. 
It is playable only in either online or local split screen cooperative multiplayer between two players.
It Takes Two received favorable reviews from critics and won multiple year-end accolades, 
including the Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021 and the 25th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. 
The game was a commercial success, with more than 10 million copies sold by February 2023.

It Takes Two is an action-adventure video game with elements from platform games. 
It is specifically designed for split-screen cooperative multiplayer, 
which means that it must be played with another player through either local or online play. 
The game features a large number of game mechanics from various video game genres.
These gameplay mechanics are connected to the story and the theme of the level. For instance, 
in one level, Cody gains the ability to rewind time, whereas May can replicate herself. 
Players have to cooperate with each other and utilize these abilities in order to progress. 
The game also features a large number of minigames.

                <pre>
Josef Fares, the director of Hazelight's previous game A Way Out (2018) and Starbreeze's Brothers: 
A Tale of Two Sons (2013), returned and directed a team of 60 people to develop the game. 
After releasing A Way Out in 2018, the team decided to create another co-op only video game because it had a more experienced and
refined team and the team felt that they could further improve and expand the gameplay concepts introduced by A Way Out. 
The development team worked to ensure that the gameplay had connection with the narrative, 
and that as the story unfolds, the game's mechanics will change accordingly. 
Fares pushed his team to include as many mechanics and setpieces as possible since he believed that if a gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly, 
it will become "less special".[5] Fares described the game as a "romantic comedy". 
Fares provided motion capture for Dr. Hakim, one of the key characters in the game.
The game was written mostly in AngelScript, which was implemented into the Unreal Engine by Hazelight through their own plugin.

                <pre>
Cody and May, a married couple, are planning on getting a divorce. 
After telling their daughter Rose the news, she takes her hand-made dolls, 
which look like her parents, into the family shed and tries to repair their relationship by play-acting. 
The parents find themselves trapped inside the dolls' bodies as a consequence of Rose's tears landing on the dolls. 
Dr. Hakim, who has assumed the anthropomorphic form of his relationship therapy book, 
tells May and Cody that he has been given the job of trying to fix their relationship as they try to reach Rose.
