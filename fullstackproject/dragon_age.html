            <h2>Dragon Age: Inquisition</h2>
            <pre>
is a 2014 action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts.
The third major game in the Dragon Age franchise, Inquisition is the sequel to Dragon Age II (2011).
The story follows a player character known as the Inquisitor on a journey to settle the civil unrest in 
the continent of Thedas and close a mysterious tear in 
the sky called the "Breach", which is unleashing dangerous demons upon the world.
Dragon Age: Inquisition's gameplay is similar to its predecessors, 
although it consists of several semi-open worlds for players to explore. 
Players control the Inquisitor or their companions mainly from a third-person perspective, 
although a traditional role-playing game top-down camera angle is also available.

            <pre>
Dragon Age: Inquisition is an action role-playing game similar to its predecessors.
At the beginning of the game, the player chooses a race for their player character: human, dwarf, elf, or Qunari,
a playable race for the first time in the series.
Players customize the Inquisitor's physical appearance and gender, among other things.
Players can access a cloud-based online interactive story creator called Dragon Age Keep, and detail the major plots of 
the previous two Dragon Age games and import a world state in Inquisition without requiring replay of the initial games.
The game has a semi-open world structure, as the world is broken up into several sections, which players can freely explore.
To allow players to navigate the game's world faster, mounts, creatures players can ride, are introduced.
The various regions that make up the game world do not scale in level,
meaning players can be too weak or strong for the enemies found in a region.
In each hub world, players can complete side activities such as sealing Fade rifts and capturing keeps or forts, 
establish camps, which are used to provide fast travel and resupply points.
Performing these acts will grant players resource points in Influence, 
which can be used to unlock global upgrades for the Inquisition named Inquisition perk, and Power, 
which is required for progressing the story and unlocking new areas.
In addition, the player can complete side missions, fetch quests, collect magical shards, 
and solve Astrarium puzzles. Players can also collect codex entries, allowing them to have a deeper understanding about the world of Thedas.
In Inquisition, players can interact with numerous non-playable characters, some of whom can be recruited as agents for the Inquisition.
A dialogue wheel offers several dialogue options for the player to select.

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <pre>
Development for Dragon Age: Inquisition began in 2011. 
BioWare's biggest single-player video game at the time of its release, 
development for the project revolved around five core "design pillars": "story", "characters", "open world", "choices", and "personalise".
The central idea for the game, namely that there would be an institution inspired by the historical Inquisition and the player character would be its leader,
was intended originally to be the follow-up to Dragon Age: Origins, though its progress was halted completely when EA forced BioWare to 
rush the development of Dragon Age II.
Conception of the game began in 2011;[48] production began in 2012.
Initially, the team had the choice to revisit Jade Empire (2006), or create a new intellectual property (IP).
However, they were content to develop a new installment in the Dragon Age franchise as they believed it had more "pull"
and consumer "awareness" than Jade Empire, and recognized that creating a new IP would be too large an undertaking.
David Gaider returned as the game's lead writer, while Mike Laidlaw and Mark Darrah served as its creative director and executive producer, respectively. 
Jeremie Voillot and Michael Kent served as joint audio directors of Inquisition, reprising their similar roles from Dragon Age II.

            <pre>
BioWare faced the challenge of seeding story content in the largest single-player game world it had created at the time with relatively few design staff.
The developmental team decided to split up and experimented with disparate techniques in order to achieve the desired content scope and density.
The narrative design team's goal was to generate discrete narrative content, while the technical design team wanted to implement standalone, dynamic systems.
The end result was  that the narrative designers discovered that the content they wrote had scaled poorly, whereas the technical team found that their work had a disconnected impact.
During their presentation at the GDC in 2015, narrative designer Kaelin Lavallee and technical designer Mark Wilson explained that their respective teams decided to meet somewhere in 
the middle and work out a collaborative approach in order to build a large fantasy world that could properly scale in design.
Examples of gameplay features given by Lavallee and Wilson which combine storytelling and level design include interactive objects that litter gameplay levels like the 
Astrarium puzzles and Ocularum artifacts which detect "shards", as well as a dynamic banter system which superseded banter system from previous games in 
the series which were triggered at specific locations in the game world.
Lavallee and Wilson suggested that the teams were able to overcome some of the challenges of populating the large game world of Inquisition by combining story and systems, 
and concluded that the game's story content was a responsibility for everyone involved regardless of their defined role in the developmental cycle.
The development team recognised that Hawke's story lacked "clarity" and was "convoluted" and identified it as the main reason why Dragon Age II did not resonate with some players.
This was because the story does not have an overarching villain and mainly explores how major events in the world influence Hawke's life.
