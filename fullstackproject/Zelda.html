      <h2>about The Legend of Zelda</h2>
   <pre>
    The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild[b] is a 2017 action-adventure game developed and published by
    Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U consoles.
    The game is an installment of The Legend of Zelda series and is set at the end of its timeline.
    The player controls an amnesiac Link, who awakens from a hundred-year slumber,
    and attempts to regain his memories, save princess Zelda and prevent the further destruction of Hyrule by Calamity Ganon.
    Similar to the original 1986 Legend of Zelda, players are given minimal instruction and can explore the open world freely. 
    Tasks include collecting various items and gear to aid in objectives such as puzzle-solving or side quests. 
    The world features minimal structure and is designed to encourage exploration and experimentation, 
    and the main story quest can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.
    Development of Breath of the Wild took place over five years, 
    following the responses from some fans who wanted a larger game world to explore. 
    Wanting to rethink the conventions of the series, 
    Nintendo introduced elements such as detailed chemistry and physics engines. Monolith Soft, 
    known for their work on the open world Xenoblade Chronicles series, assisted in designing landscapes and topography. 
    The game was originally planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive but was delayed twice.
    Released on March 3, 2017, Breath of the Wild was a 
    launch game for the Nintendo Switch and the final Nintendo-published game for the Wii U. 
    Two waves of downloadable content were released in 2017 via an expansion pass.
    Breath of the Wild received universal acclaim, with praise for its open-ended gameplay,
    open world design, and attention to detail, 
    although it received minor criticism for its technical performance at launch. 
    It won several Game of the Year awards and has since been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. 
    Breath of the Wild is also the top selling game in the series and one of the best-selling video games of all time,
    selling more than 27 million copies by 2022. A spin-off, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, was released in 2020.
    A sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, is scheduled for 2023.

   <h2>Gameplay</h2>
   <pre>
    Breath of the Wild is an open world action-adventure game. 
   Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link.
    Breath of the Wild encourages nonlinear gameplay, 
    which is illustrated by the game's lack of defined entrances or exits to areas,
    scant instruction given to the player, and encouragement to explore freely.
    Breath of the Wild introduces a consistent physics engine to the Zelda series, 
    letting players approach problems in different ways rather than trying to find a single solution.
    The game also integrates a "chemistry engine" that defines the physical properties of 
    most objects and governs how they interact with the player and one another.
    For example, during thunderstorms, metal objects will attract powerful lightning strikes; during a storm, 
    therefore, a player must be careful not to carry metal,

    <h2>Development</h2>
   <pre>
    Nintendo EPD, an internal division of Nintendo, developed Breath of the Wild for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U.
    According to series producer Eiji Aonuma, the development team aimed to "rethink the conventions of Zelda".
    Development started immediately upon the release of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (2011).
    Aonuma received comments from players who wished 
    to see a more interconnected map to explore the locales between the gameplay areas.
    In 2013, Nintendo experimented with nonlinear gameplay in The Legend of Zelda: A 
    Link Between Worlds,which was a common point of praise from many outlets. 
    At E3 2014, Aonuma said he planned to reform dungeons and puzzles, two of the series' major gameplay elements,
    and redesign the game to allow players to reach the end without progressing through the story.
    As Nintendo had never developed an open-world game on the scale of Breath of the Wild, 
    they looked at The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Shadow of the Colossus,
    the latter of which had some similar climbing mechanics and whose creator, Fumito Ueda, was friends with Aonuma.
    For the art style, the team drew inspiration from various Japanese anime which they had grown up watching, 
    suspected to include Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki productions, among other anime.

            <h2>Plot</h2>
   <pre>
    Breath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule.
    In ancient times, the ancient Sheikah race had developed Hyrule into an advanced civilization, 
    protected by four enormous animalistic machines called the Divine Beasts and an army of autonomous weapons called Guardians.
    When an ancient evil known as Calamity Ganon appeared and threatened Hyrule, four great warriors were given the title of Champion,
    and each piloted one of the Divine Beasts to weaken Ganon while the princess with the blood of the goddess and 
    her appointed knight fought and defeated him by sealing him away.
    Ten millennia later, the kingdom of Hyrule had since regressed to a medieval state.
    Reading their ancestors' prophecies, 
    the Hylians recognized the signs of Ganon's return and excavated surrounding areas to uncover the Divine Beasts and Guardians.
    During this time, 
    Princess Zelda trained vigorously to awaken the sealing magic needed to defeat Ganon while trying to maintain her personal research.
    In the meantime, a knight was appointed to protect her: Link,
    who was chosen due to his ability to wield the Master Sword, also known as "the sword that seals the darkness".
    After being sought out by Zelda, the Champions—Mipha, princess of the aquatic Zora; Revali, 
    archer of the birdlike Rito; Daruk, warrior of the mountainous Gorons; and Urbosa, 
    chief of the desert-dwelling Gerudo—assembled to pilot the Divine Beasts.
